One white police officer knelt on Floyd\\'s neck for a total of 8 minutes and 46 seconds, leading to his death. Prior to this, the four officers handcuffed Floyd and held him in a facedown position. Three of the officers applied pressure to his neck, torso, and back. Floyd repeatedly said \"I can\\'t breathe\" before falling unconscious. Floyd was taken away by EMTs and later pronounced dead. All four officers were fired. The officer who used his knee to pin Floyd down was charged with second-degree murder. The other three officers were charged with aiding and abetting the murder. This event has galvanized support for the Black Lives Matter movement and triggered demonstrations worldwide.'"
